Housing market shows pent-up demand as new home sales slow
In the month of January, new home sales rose less than expected, with only 661,000 new homes sold. With mortgage rates remaining close to 7%, potential homebuyers may still be wary to enter the US housing market. Could 2024 continue the housing trends seen from last year? National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun joins Yahoo Finance to share insights into housing market trends expected for this year. In terms of housing demand, Yu states: "There is definitely a large degree of pent-up demand, along with even delayed sellers, sellers who have life-changing circumstances — having additional child in the family, maybe a retirement age, maybe a new job that requires different commuting patterns — so all these delayed sellers are waiting for the rates to drop before listing their home, along with many buyers. The home sales closing activity is reflecting the interest rate of what was occurring in December."

Weekly Stock List
Value stocks -- a market segment that includes high-yield stocks -- outperformed growth stocks in 2022. That's a recent rarity, as for more than a decade, the performance record favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 575%, compared to an advance of almost 200% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In 10 of the past 13 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, including the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% (but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade). Value investors trace their roots to the famous "Security Analysis" textbook, written by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. Warren Buffett was one of his students. Why the recent deviation in performance? Several reasons, including changes in the make-up of the economy, growth in intangible assets, and the current level of interest rates. But the tide turned back in 2022, at least for a while, as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gave a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy and regional banks) that had lagged in recent years. While growth stocks have recaptured the lead since 2023, the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high to fend off inflation. This could possibly cap multiple expansion for growth companies in coming quarters. In any event, the value sector is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.0%, compared to the 0.7% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For our list this week, we have screened our coverage universe for stocks that are BUY-rated by Argus Research analysts, have an Argus Financial Strength Rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.0% or higher. Here's a baker's dozen that meet the criteria. These stocks are also featured in our High-Yield theme model portfolio.
