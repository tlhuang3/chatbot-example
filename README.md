This Repo is for practising the LLM + RAG procedures
The folder Full_Stack_Chatbot_RAG contains all the code for productionizing the RAG applications.
Here I use a few .txt files containing the quarterly results from Nvidia to showcase the RAG capabilities.
The performance can be improved from parsing the content from Nvidia's website more sufficiently and chunking the text more structurally.
